            I work as a freelance software engineer. I love solving business problems with reliable, well-proven
            technology.

        <span class="font-bold">Past</span>
        <p>
          Most recently, I was part of a startup that scaled from its beginnings to enterprise clients in the reverse
          logistics and returns space, helping major retailers turn returns into revenue and sustainability wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before that, I managed the development of a solutions-product for maritime safety operations, led a team
          building a medical drug information and interaction system, co-founded a startup analyzing real estate
          transactions, and prototyped software for air traffic and maritime control centers.
        </p>
